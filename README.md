# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple yet powerful algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks in machine learning. The core idea is to predict the value or class of a data point based on the "k" closest examples in the training dataset.

## What is KNN?

- **Instance-Based Learning:** KNN is a lazy learner, meaning it doesn't learn a discriminative function from the training data but rather memorizes the training dataset. It makes predictions based on the proximity of a query point to the stored data.
- **Distance Metrics:** The algorithm uses distance measures (e.g., Euclidean, Manhattan) to identify the nearest neighbors.
- **Decision Process:**  
  - For **classification**, KNN assigns the class that is most common among its k nearest neighbors.  
  - For **regression**, it averages the values of the k nearest neighbors to predict the outcome.

## Key Characteristics

- **Non-Parametric:** KNN does not assume any underlying data distribution, making it flexible and applicable to various types of data.
- **Simple and Intuitive:** Its straightforward approach makes it easy to understand and implement.
- **Adaptability:** The choice of "k" and the distance metric can be tuned based on the specific dataset and problem at hand.

## Advantages

- Easy to implement and interpret.
- Naturally handles multi-class classification problems.
- No training phase is required, which makes it suitable for applications where the training data is frequently updated.

## Disadvantages

- Can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.
- Performance heavily depends on the choice of "k" and the distance metric.
- Sensitive to the scale of the data and to irrelevant features, which may require preprocessing like normalization or feature selection.
